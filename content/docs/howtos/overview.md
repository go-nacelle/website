## "How-to" guides

Here you'll find short answers to "How do I...?" types of questions.

---

These how-to guides don't cover topics in depth - you'll find the material in the [Using Nacelle](/docs/topics) and the [reference](/docs/ref) documentation. However, these guides will help you quickly accomplish common tasks.

- [How to validate user-supplied configuration values](/docs/howtos/config_validation)
- [How to adjust the caller frame in log messages](/docs/howtos/log_adjust_caller)
- [How to track process health](/docs/howtos/process_health)
- [How to inject dependencies into composite fields](/docs/howtos/service_composite)
- [How to run custom code after service injection](/docs/howtos/service_post_injection_hook)
- [How to inject services recursively into struct fields](/docs/howtos/service_recursion)

If you are looking to solve a problem that is not covered here, please [suggest a new how-to guide](https://github.com/go-nacelle/nacelle/issues/new/choose).
