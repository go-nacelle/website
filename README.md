# Nacelle Docs Website

This website is built via [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and continuously deployed via [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

### Developing Locally

Running `hugo serve` will start a local live-reload server on port 1313. Editing the markdown files in `content`, the theme in `layout`, or the style and image files in `static` will trigger a rebuild.
